# FolderImageResizer

# WARNING !!! BAD CODE !!!

This command line program allows you to resize all images from a folder of your choosing. Input a file type you want to resize from the folder.  Input width and height as integer or "{number}X" like "2X" will make all the images two times bigger than they originally were.

I made this because a classmate needed to resize 60 images but found no program to do that, so I made this not like the classmate needs it anymore but I think this is just C# training and I could potentially use it in the future.
